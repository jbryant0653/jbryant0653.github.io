# Way of Thinking

### R. D. Tennent principles:

1. The Principle of Abstraction:
    
    Simplifying conceptually hard systems or ideas to be understood easier: It's how high schools can learn physics now when back then the books were super complex and confusing.  
    Abstraction is important but at some point, we have to leave the abstraction world and get more real and complex such as in Physics 3 classes where they include drag and all other forces.  
    
2. The Principle of Correspondence:
    
    Actually taking theory and converting it to the real world: This is the difference between learning ciphers, how they work, their vulnerabilities, and implementing a PKI in a company environment which takes many more skills and is much more difficult.  
    Given this, when learning at the beginning it is super important to learn abstractly first and then grow into correspondence.  
    
3. The Principle of Data Type Completeness:
    
    I perceive this principle as a guideline to not hyperfocus but to have small baby skills that cover all domains of a given topic. So to not just use one program for a given type of challenge but understand and branch out your skills. Learn the well-known text editors, their history, and the pros and cons. Sure you may focus on using one but knowing them all a little bit can turn out to be super important!
    

### Knowing when to grow:

- When you are trying to figure out how something works it normally means your missing something and this is the moment you can learn what you truly know what you know and what you donâ€™t know!
- This skill takes practice and it is important to embrace this process and use it to add to your Data Type Completeness.
