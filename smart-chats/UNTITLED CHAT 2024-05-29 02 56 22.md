Summarize my note on a ctf named wario party

##### assistant
Wario Party is a Stego challenge in which you are given a PNG image and a hint that suggests looking for data at the intersection of Mario's color and the number of brothers. The image contains messed-up data in the R2 bit plane, which can be extracted using StegOnline to reveal a hidden JPG containing Marios and Warios. The JPG is binary, and when decoded using CyberChef, it reveals the flag: `bronco{b0ws3r_g0t_th4t_dumpy}`.

Explain the bit plane explanation with that same note.

{"hypotheticals":["WarioWare: Smooth Moves > Wario Party > CTF > Bit Plane Explanation:\n\nIn the CTF mini-game of WarioWare: Smooth Moves, understanding the bit plane manipulation is crucial for solving the puzzle. Here's a breakdown of the bit plane concept:\n\n1. **Bit Planes**: In computer graphics, a bit plane is a representation of an image where each bit corresponds to a specific level of detail. For example, a 4-bit plane can represent 16 different levels of detail (0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111).\n\n2. **Bitwise Operations**: To manipulate bit planes, we use bitwise operations such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOT. These operations work on individual bits of the binary representation of numbers.\n\n3. **AND Operation**: The AND operation sets the result bit to 1 only if both input bits are 1. In the context of CTF, this operation can be used to light up specific pixels based on the pattern of the bit plane.\n\n4. **OR Operation**: The OR operation sets the result bit to 1 if either of the input bits is 1. This operation can be used to combine bit planes or to light up multiple pixels at once.\n\n5. **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation sets the result bit to 1 if the two input bits are different. This operation can be used to toggle the state of specific pixels or to create complex patterns.\n\n6. **NOT Operation**: The NOT operation inverts the state"]}

Explain the bit plane part of my note on wario party ctf

##### assistant
In the Wario Party CTF challenge, the image provided contains encoded data in its bit planes. Bit planes are a way to represent an image using multiple planes, each containing the binary representation of the image's color values. In this case, the encoded data is hidden in the Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B) bit planes of the image.

The encoded data is hidden in the Least Significant Bits (LSB) of each pixel in the R, G, and B bit planes. The LSB is the rightmost bit of each pixel's color value. By encoding data in the LSB, the original image is minimally affected, making it harder to detect the hidden data visually.

To extract the hidden data, you can use steganography tools such as StegSolve or StegOnline. These tools can analyze the bit planes of an image and extract hidden data if it exists. In the Wario Party CTF challenge, you can use StegOnline to extract the hidden JPG file from the R2 bit plane of the image. The extracted JPG file contains the flag for the challenge.
